                                 the well known sports have. They are no different in many aspects from the real sports, besides the fact that they are not practiced out of the virtual
                                  world and for that reason they have the 'e' in esports which means eletronic. Check some of the games that Bloody Pistols Gaming will be playing!

                    <p><b>League of Legends</b> (abbreviated LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
                         The game follows a freemium model and is supported by microtransactions, and was inspired by the Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod, Defense of the Ancients. 
                           In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or 
                             computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures,
                              although other distinct game modes exist as well. Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all champions starting off fairly weak but increases in strength by 
                              accumulating items and experience over the course of the game.[2] The champions and setting blend a variety of elements, including high fantasy, steampunk, and 
                              Lovecraftian horror. </p>

                    <p><b>Fortnite</b> is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share
                         the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like
                         tures and defend objects with fortifications they can build, Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to 
                         be the last person standing, and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The first two game modes
                          were released in 2017 as early access titles and Creative was released on December 6, 2018. Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation
                           4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale has been released for those platforms and additionally for Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices. Playing either
                            Fortnite game requires an Epic Games account on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. Playing on PS4 or Xbox does not need an Epic Games 
                            account, as players are identified by their PSN or Xbox Live username instead. </p>

                    <p><b>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</b> is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. It is
                         the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series and was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 on August 21, 2012, while the Linux 
                         version was released in 2014. The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked with eliminating 
                         the other while also completing separate objectives. The Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while the
                          Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages.  There are nine game modes, all of which have
                           distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, as well as 
                           allowing members of the community to host their own servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in 
                           2018.  </p>
